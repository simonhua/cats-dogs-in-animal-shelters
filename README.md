Using ensemble and classification methods to predict whether certain dogs and cats end up being adopted, euthanized, or transported/other.

We trained on a dataset containing observations of cats and dogs and their various traits.  Using this training set, we implemented a model that was then used to predict the status of dogs and cats in a testing set.
